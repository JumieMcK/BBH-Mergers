The multiple_custom_priors file is an upgraded version of the code used to create the chirp mass prior object. 
The code now instead can create multiple bilby priors from the dataset.
It is accompanied by the respective txt files for each prior which include the value of the prior and also the probability density
The priors this code creates are : "chirp mass prior","q prior", "chieff prior", "z prior", "m1 prior", "m2 prior".
