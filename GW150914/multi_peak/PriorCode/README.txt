This prior consits of an exponential turn on in the black hole mass distribution at low masses. As mass increases, the prior features a decreasing power law interupted by two Gaussian peaks. The first peak is situated at roughly 35 Solar masses where a build up of black holes has been observed - see Figure 1 of (Talbot, Thrane 2018), doi:10.3847/1538-4357/aab34c. The second peak is a proposed build up of black holes within the mass gap at roughly 70 Solar masses.
