This prior consists of an exponential turn on in the population of black holes at small masses. Features a decreasing powerlaw with a Gaussian peak at 35 solar masses that is consistent with observations - see Figure 1 of (Talbot, Thrane 2018), doi:10.3847/1538-4357/aab34c. This prior also considers no black holes in the theoretical mass gap between 50 and 90 solar masses. The decreasing powerlaw continues after 90 solar masses.
