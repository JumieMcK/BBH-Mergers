# BBH-Mergers
Analysing black hole binaries in astrophysical context (Project 718)

These are the files I used to run GW190521 analysis that took ~4 days to run with not such good results with the default prior so I don't recommend running it unless you adjust the prior to have larger mass/chirp mass ranges. If you do use these scripts just make sure you change the directories to our student numbers otherwise it will go into mine.
