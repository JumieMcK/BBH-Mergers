In the bash file is the SCP command to download folders with the results from the joint directory on wiay. The example shows how I would download the XP waveform results from the directory to my own laptops desktop. This command is used BEFORE SSH-ing(i.e when you're not connected to wiay and just at your terminal on your pc). I should note I had a few issues finding my desktop directory for my specific laptop so you might need to look online and mess around a bit to get yours(or wherever you'd like to store it).
